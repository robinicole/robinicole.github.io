# Just for fun
Below are some personal projects of javascript based websites created using vibe-coding. Some were created using only Claude/chatGPT other were created using agentic coding assistant such as claude Code:

- [Taginator](/taginator.html) convert the price of good in Tagine equivalent. Why? because why not ? 
- [Range ta chambre GPT](/rangetachambreGPT.html) Some people say that chatbot can be time consuming and distract kids from daily tasks like cleaning their room, this is why I created rangeTaChambre GPT, a chatGPT like website which tells your kid to clean their room. Even though it looks like chatGPT it is 100% genAI free.
- [Obsidian-Hugo Sync](https://github.com/robinicole/robinicole.github.io/tree/main/scripts/hugo-obsidian-sync) a command-line utility to write blog posts in Obsidian and sync them with a Hugo blog. I use it to write the articles for this blog.
- [Synoptik.app](https://synoptik.app/) is a follow-up to the work started in the [book_graph_for_llms post]({{< ref "book_graph_for_llms.md" >}}). For simplicity, the graphs are displayed as mermaid diagrams.
- [Xmas List](https://xmas-list-three.vercel.app/) a Christmas list CRM (Work in progress).
