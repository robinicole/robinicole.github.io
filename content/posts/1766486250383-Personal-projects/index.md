# Just for fun
Below are some personal projects of javascript based websites created using vibe-coding. Some were created using only Claude/chatGPT other were created using agentic coding assistant such as claude Code:

- [Taginator](/taginator.html) convert the price of good in Tagine equivalent. Why? because why not ? 
- [Range ta chambre GPT](/rangetachambreGPT.html) Some people say that chatbot can be time consuming and distract kids from daily tasks like cleaning their room, this is why I created rangeTaChambre GPT, a chatGPT like website which tells your kid to clean their room. Even though it looks like chatGPT it is 100% genAI free.
