- [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) I particularly recommend his general audience **"Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT"** on under-the hood fundamentals of LLMs. **"How I use LLMs"**, a more practical guide to examples of LLM use. You will also find on his channel video targeted toward a more advanced audience where he teaches you how to build a simple character level LLM like chatGPT in plain pytorch. You can also find his blog [here](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/).
- [Deep learning with Yacine](https://www.youtube.com/@deeplearningexplained): good basic machine learning explanations. I like the fact that the explanation on this channel are targeted toward fundamental understanding of LLMs function and not toward high level/business understanding of LLM. I recommend his videos on the deepseek model
- [Yannick Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/@YannicKilcher) Interesting review of papers, his [discord channel](https://ykilcher.com/discord) is also a goldmine with frequent discussion on paper about LLM and adjacent topics.
