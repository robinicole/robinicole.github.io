With the current buzz around LLMs, it can be hard to find information that is reliable and free from the hype noise and advertisements.
This is my personal list of resources *guaranteed free from bullshit content*.

**Info:** this list will grow as I discover new resources

## Here we are
- [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) I particularly recommend his general audience **"Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT"** on under-the hood fundamentals of LLMs. **"How I use LLMs"**, a more practical guide to examples of LLM use. You will also find on his channel video targeted toward a more advanced audience where he teaches you how to build a simple character level LLM like chatGPT in plain pytorch. You can also find his blog [here](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/).
- [Deep learning with Yacine](https://www.youtube.com/@deeplearningexplained): good basic machine learning explanations. I like the fact that the explanation on this channel are targeted toward fundamental understanding of LLMs function and not toward high level/business understanding of LLM. I recommend his videos on the deepseek model
- [Yannick Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/@YannicKilcher) Interesting review of papers, his [discord channel](https://ykilcher.com/discord) is also a goldmine with frequent discussion on paper about LLM and adjacent topics.
