## Braindump
This is a braindump of thought to be organized into an article to describe where I think AI is taking us.

- The effect of knowledge generation automation will share similarities with the previous automation of manual work and we will observe two distinct classes of knowledge/content: 1. Low added value basic knowledge that was generated with minimal human intervention (the IKEA furniture equivalent of knowledge) 2. Prenium, knowledge which was carefully generated by humans (the equivalent of handcrafted furnitures)

- Knowledge will be generated at increasing speed in a self sustaining loop where the R&D to generate new more powerful LLMS will be stimulated by the new capabilities of LLMS

## Resource 
- https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/12/30/the-rise-of-industrial-software super interesting post that draw a parallel between the current knowledge automation with AI and the previous automation in textile which lead to having two categories of good: low effort / low value  (created with heavy automation use) v.s. high effort/high value (manually and carefully crafted). They argue that in the particular case of software the R&D will make the artisan niche highly valuable.
