As an expat working in the UK, understanding how to save your money and what impact it has on your taxes can prove daunting. This is why I created this summary of what I wish I knew when I arrived in the UK few years ago. Namely how to optimize your taxes while living in the UK. 

# Taxes 101 

## Income tax
Depending on how much **salary** you earn, your will fall on a different tax bracket. As expected the more you earn the more you will have to share with his majesty the king as explained on [his own website](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates). Those one the higher tax bracket (you lucky over 125k earners) will end up having their income taxed at 45%. In such cases optimizing your taxes by adjusting your pension, investing in tax efficient investments (VCT, SEIS...) can be an interesting strategy to reduce your taxes. 

## Capital gain taxes
If you invested in the stock market via a GIA (general investment account) or earned interest via a saving account which sums to more than 3000 GBP you will also have to pay taxes one the capital earned above the 3000 GBP. For example if you got 4000 GBP capital gains you will have to pay taxes on 4000 - 3000 = 1000 GBP. In general if you can try to keep your capital gains below this threshold.

# The simple method to reduce your tax liabilities
There is 3 simple tool you can use to grow your capital:
- **Your pension**: money you put aside and can receive when you are over 55 following certain condition.
- **Your stock and shares ISA** this is an investment account to which you can add 20 000 GBP each year and whose gain will be tax free (sorry mister king :)
- **Your saving account** It is good practice to have aside saving to cover for 3 month to a year of your cost of living, keep this money in a saving account to make it earn up to 4% interest rate per year.

## The pension
The pension is not money you will earn right now but money you put aside in an investment account and that grows until you are at an age where you have the right to receive this money. Most people invest in their pension through their job via a salary sacrifice (you put 5% of your salary in your pension every month) and often your employer is going to match your contribution to a certain percentage. On top of that HMRC is going to also to to up the sum invested in your pension by 30% with money from their own pockets and your pension will also lead to income tax reduction. Making it a tool of choice to reduce your income taxes. To summarize, the following characteristics: 
- employer matching contribution (in certain cases)
- HMRC top up of 30% of the pension
- Income taxes reduction 
Make the pension a tool of choice to reduce your tax liabilities. If you have been having several jobs, it is likely you pension ended up splitted between various pension provider (L&G, Fidelity, ...) I would suggest to keep your current work pension provider but to gather all the pensions of your previous jobs under the same provider. I tend to use Vanguard to keep track of my pension, GIA, and ISA and would advise you to do the same. 

## Stock and shares ISA
The United Kingdom in its infinite kindness created the stock and shares ISA which allows you to invest 20 000 GBP tax free every year. The rule is simple then, If you plan to invest less than 20 000 GBP this should be done using an ISA only. If you want to invest more than 20 000 GBP because you received a lump sum of money or because your salary allows you to, then you will need to create a GIA. Same as for the pension I recommend to use Vanguard to invest as it has very low fee and proposes a small number of funds which are all diversified. The small number of funds may seems like a disadvantage at first but it protect you from the temptation to do risky investment and potentially lose large sums of money. 

When investing it can be tempting to follow the flood of information on social media and invest in the last tech company or in the last crypto. I encourage you not to do this just o invest in an index fund. An index fund follows a large number of companies (the biggest american companies for the S&P 500 for example) and is hence well diversified leading to more stable evolution of your money. Each year you are likely to grow your money by 6 - 10 %. It is worth noting that with a gain of 6% each year which is below what you could get with famous index funds such as the (MSCI World, S&P 500) you would **double the money you invested in 12 years**. 

## Saving account
If you have some money sleeping aside either for your emergency fund or because you are saving for a deposit for a mortgage for example, you want this money to work for your and earn interest. This is the role of the saving account. Depending on your provider, the interest rate of your saving account can vary significatively, this is why I recommend to have a look at this [list of the best saving accounts from Money Saving experts](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-accounts-best-interest/) before making a decision on where to store you hard earned money. Note that the longer you agree not to use your money the higher the interest rate will be.
